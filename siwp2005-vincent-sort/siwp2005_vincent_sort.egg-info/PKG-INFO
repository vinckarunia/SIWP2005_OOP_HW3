# Sorting Algorithms

This package provides a collection of sorting algorithms implemented in Python. The following sorting algorithms are included:

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Quick Sort

## Algorithms

- Bubble Sort : Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

- Insertion Sort : Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms.

- Quick Sort : Quick Sort is an efficient sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to quickly sort elements in a list.
